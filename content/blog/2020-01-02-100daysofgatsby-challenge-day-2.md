### Progress of Day 2

Today was a lot more time consuming than I thought so I could only finish Step 2 & 3 from the [Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/).

But out of interest I was reading [Standard, Global CSS Files](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/global-css/) & [React: CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js)

In Step 3, I was also using the often-used `Typography.js`-Plugin also I knew that I want to style my Blog with `TailwindCSS`
