### Foreword

I assigned and committed to the `#100DaysOfGatsby`-Challenge quite late or to name it correctly in the morning of the 01.01.2020.

Then I was unsure if this challenge already started, but I was quite lucky that currently, no one got some information about this challenge. To get more information and help I joined [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/gatsby) and the [GoogleGroup](https://bamadesigner.com/gatsby/) which was started from Rachel Cherry, you can find it [here](https://bamadesigner.com/gatsby/) if you still want to join.

The next Steps I did because the Challenge hasnâ€™t started yet was reading through [100DaysOfCode.com](https://100DaysOfCode.com)

I agree & commit to this `Two Main Rules`
- Code minimum an hour every day for the next 100 days.
- Tweet my progress every day with the `#100DaysOfGatsby` and `#100DaysOfCode` hashtag

I added a few more rules:
- I will update the Blog (Log) with the dayâ€™s progress and provide some details, that others understand and follow what I did.
- I will push my code to GitHub so that anyone can see my progress.

What was the main reason to commit to [#100DaysOfGatsby](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfGatsby) and [#100DaysOfCode](https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysOfCode):
- Learning some new technologies in 2020 (React, GraphQL, Gatsby, TailwindCSS ...)
- I wanted to create a blog a long time ago, but I was always thinking I donâ€™t have enough content. Now that I should publish something daily, thatâ€™s no excuse anymore ðŸ˜‰
- To get me some `me` time, besides working, school, hobbies and private life ðŸ¤ª
- And of course to improve my English writing skills

Now I will start my journey, and hopefully, you will also join and learn more about Gatsby.

If you have any questions or want more details to a Topic, you can send me a message that I can add it.

### Progress of Day 1 - Start the Challenge

- Reading the Rules [100DaysOfCode.com](https://100DaysOfCode.com), see also above
- Reading the [this Article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4/) to know how I could prepare and stick on the challenge

After receiving the Challenge for the first Week `Create your own Blog` within the Mail at about 3 pm, I was following the recommendation's and dig into the [Tutorial of Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/)

I was going through Step 0 and 1 from the Tutorial and [here GitHub Repository to Step 1](https://github.com/garandam/gatsby-hello-world)

I wrote these following topics into different Blogs because, in the future, they are still relevant and interesting to read.

- Setup Development Environment (see other Blog-Post - coming soon)
- Setup Github - Project (see other Blog-Post - coming soon)
